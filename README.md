Project Directory Structure
---------------------------

* `generated`
  * Files generated by the build process.  Currently this is the output of the
    protocol buffer compiler.

* `external`
  * External dependencies for the project.  Currently only contains the
    `node_modules` directory populated by npm using the standard methods.

* `dev_container`
  * Code for setting up and controlling the container used for building and
    running the project.  The intention is to create a checked in and
    reproducible state for the development environment, losening requirements on
    the host system used to do development.

* `src/potato`
  * Where all the code lives.  See src/potato/README.md for more.
