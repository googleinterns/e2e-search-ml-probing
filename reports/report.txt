Youtube.videos.insert:
    Youtube.videos.list: find the video even when the video isn't fully loaded
    puppeteer:
        2 different searches: 
            1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOME_ID 
            2) SOME_ID
        sometime find search 1 but not search 2, or sometime search 2 but not search 1
        in some country take more time than others
        after a while it will find both 1 and 2 for every country

Youtube.videos.update:
    Is like Youtube.videos.insert but more slower with puppeteer, it take like 1 minute at least to see the changes



Possible problems:
    the shard where i'm making the request is not updated
    in that moment the server is full, so the load balancer send my request to the best second option
